<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Did you know that people forget things in under 30 seconds? That's why we created Noteworthy.

### Built With

We built our app with pure Typescript, then we transpile our code to JS. After compiling it to code that the browser can read we bundled our code into one minified file with Gulp. This is the file that we use for the chrome extension.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_There are a few ways to install noteworthy_

1. Chrome Webstore

a. The Chrome Webstore is the easiest way to install Noteworthy but sometimes updates get delayed. First, go to the app's page on the [Chrome Web Store](https://example.com)

b. Click install, go to a page and click on the extension. A dropdown should open which will allow you to markdown the page. Once you're done you can leave the page and all of your notes will stay when you return

2. Bookmarklet

a. If you want to test Noteworthy before downloading it, you can run a bookmarklet. A bookmarklet is a Javascript in a bookmark, this bookmark has the be run every time you load a page making this not a long-term way to download.

b. Go to the [GitHub Pages](https://example.com) and drag the link that says "bookmarklet" into your bookmarks bar. (If it is hidden, press Ctrl + Shift + B).

3. From the source

a. Git clone the [src repo](https://example.com). Then go to chrome://extensions and click load unpacked extension. Click the folder that you clone, then dist, then click OK. This will load the extension in and you can use it normally.
